This package is a part of [@diaspora](https://github.com/diaspora-orm) base components. It exposes the base *adapter* that should be extended by every other *adapter*. It also exports the *DataAccessLayer*, the class responsible of normalizing options between [Diaspora](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@diaspora/diaspora) and the adapters.
